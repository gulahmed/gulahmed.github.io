### Course Description

This course is designed to teach object-oriented programming techniques to those who have
learned basic programming concepts. The goal of this course is to provide students with the ability
to write programs in C++ and make use of the concepts of Object-Oriented Programming.
Examples and discussions will use C++ primarily, but other languages may be used to illustrate
specific points where appropriate. The course is taught with a mixture of lectures and practical
sessions and each class will culminate in an assessed lab exercise


### Course Objectives

At the completion of this course, students will:


-  Comprehend OOP concepts like object, class, data & function
members, friend functions, message, abstraction, encapsulation,
protection, composition, inheritance, polymorphism

-  Devise objects from description implementing their structure and
behavior by defining data members, and member functions/operators
with emphases on usability
-  Appraise optimal static and dynamic usage of memory and protecting
memory breach and wastage
-  Comprehend lifespan of objects defined as entry into, computational
collaboration through messages and exit from logical spaces in
computational tasks
- Present an object-oriented design in a clear and lucid manner.
- Apply principles of encapsulation, abstraction, reusability and
extensibility to support collaborative development.
