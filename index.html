<h1>Object Oriented Programming - Namal College</h1>

<p class="message">
The course is spread over the duration of 14 to 15 weeks.  We will start by
exploring the basic  constructs provided in the C++ programming language
for procedural and object-oriented programming. Our main foucus will be
developing a general understanding of object oriented way of constructing programs
but we will try to incorporate modern C++ ecosystem and best practises.

By the end of the semester, you will be equipped to use this powerful language
and its surrounding community as a tool to solve any meaningful problems you
decide to tackle in the future!
